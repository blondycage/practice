The occasion of World Refugee Day, “Better Together” event took place on 21 June 2019 in Nicosia, Lefkeliler Inn. Throughout the event we stood against racism and the notion that it is not possible to live together; we said out loud that WE ARE BETTER TOGETHER!

We would like to extend our appreciation to the Refugee Rights Commission of the Nicosia Turkish Municipality especially to the Committee Members Öykü Akcan and Murat Kanatlı and the Mayor Mehmet Harmancı; musicians that took stage namely, DJ Uncle Mete, The Great Flood, Gizem Akbil ft. Caravan Blue, The Consonants, Bunfyah and DJ Pan Khaos; to other organizations such as Go Social Cyprus, Human Rights Committee of the Bar Association, Turkish Cypriot Human Rights Foundation, Turkish Cypriot Journalists' Association, Queer Cyprus Association, SOS Children's Village Association, Association for Historical Dialogue and Research, that enriched the event with their info stands.

We thank Grön Vegan Kitchen, Nividad Bites, Aaliyah’s Kitchen and İbocan Ercan for giving us the opportunity to taste wonderful dishes and drinks.

The event was also marked by a wonderful time of painting together and face/body paintings. We thank the Cyprus Turkish Teachers’ Trade Union and Revolutionary for providing financial assistance and showing solidarity.

We thank all personnel of VOIS Cyprus who contributed in one way or another, through the respective departments, in order to ensure that the event came together, through visuals, planning, hosting and so on! We also acknowledge the numerous individuals who played one role or another in making the event a reality!

Special thanks to our Co-Founder and Director of Social Media, Ezinne Favour Ogwuegbu, for travelling all the way from Europe to be with us during the event!

No one chooses to be a refugee. We would like to thank everyone who supported the event, ate, danced and sang with us at a night during which we have recalled our responsibilities towards refugees.

This island is #BetterTogether.
